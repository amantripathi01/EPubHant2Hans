"""
  Scenario 1: Test to verify getContentRef returns the correct contentRef
  
  Details:  
    TestName: verifyGetContentRefReturnsCorrectValue
    Description: This test is designed to verify that the getContentRef method returns the correct contentRef value. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class where the method is declared. Set the contentRef of the instance to a known value.
    Act: Invoke the getContentRef method on the instance.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the known contentRef value.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the getContentRef method correctly retrieves the value of contentRef. This is essential as it confirms the method's basic functionality.

  Scenario 2: Test to check getContentRef method when contentRef is null
  
  Details:  
    TestName: verifyGetContentRefWhenContentRefIsNull
    Description: This test is to verify that the getContentRef method returns null when contentRef is not set. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class where the method is declared. Do not set the contentRef of the instance.
    Act: Invoke the getContentRef method on the instance.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the getContentRef method correctly handles the scenario where contentRef is not set. This is important because it tests the method's robustness in handling edge cases.

  Scenario 3: Test to verify getContentRef method when contentRef is empty
  
  Details:  
    TestName: verifyGetContentRefWhenContentRefIsEmpty
    Description: This test is to check that the getContentRef method returns an empty string when contentRef is set to an empty string. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class where the method is declared. Set the contentRef of the instance to an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the getContentRef method on the instance.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is an empty string.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the getContentRef method correctly handles the scenario where contentRef is an empty string. This is crucial for ensuring the method's proper functionality in all scenarios.
  
  Scenario 4: Test to verify getContentRef method with large string values
  
  Details:  
    TestName: verifyGetContentRefWithLargeStringValues
    Description: This test is to check that the getContentRef method returns the correct value when contentRef is set to a large string. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class where the method is declared. Set the contentRef of the instance to a large string.
    Act: Invoke the getContentRef method on the instance.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the large string.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the getContentRef method correctly handles the scenario where contentRef is a large string. This is important to ensure the method's performance and memory handling capabilities.
