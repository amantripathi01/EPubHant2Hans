================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: The use of 'resourcePath + "/" + filepath' in the 'readManifest' function may allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system by providing a malicious 'filepath'. This can lead to sensitive information disclosure.
Solution: Use a secure method to map the provided 'filepath' to the intended directory. Ensure to validate and sanitize the input 'filepath' to prevent directory traversal attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: In the case of a failure in the 'readFile' function, detailed system error messages might be returned to the user, potentially exposing sensitive system information.
Solution: Catch and handle exceptions properly. Avoid returning detailed system error messages to the user. Instead, return generic error messages and log the details for debugging purposes.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: If the 'readFile' function reads a file without controlling the size of the file, it may lead to excessive consumption of system resources (like memory and CPU), possibly resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
Solution: Implement checks to ensure that the files being read do not exceed a certain size. This can prevent resource exhaustion and potential DoS attacks.

"""
Scenario 1: Valid File Path
Details:  
  TestName: testValidFilePath
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method can successfully read the content of a file when provided with a valid file path.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a valid file path as input.
  Act: Invoke the readManifest method with the valid file path.
  Assert: Verify that the returned String is not null and matches the expected content of the file.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method can correctly read a file when provided with a valid path. This is significant in ensuring the method's basic functionality.

Scenario 2: Invalid File Path
Details:  
  TestName: testInvalidFilePath
  Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles an invalid file path.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide an invalid file path as input.
  Act: Invoke the readManifest method with the invalid file path.
  Assert: Verify that an exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly throws an exception when provided with an invalid file path. This is important for error handling.

Scenario 3: Null File Path
Details:  
  TestName: testNullFilePath
  Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles a null input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a null file path as input.
  Act: Invoke the readManifest method with the null file path.
  Assert: Verify that an exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly throws an exception when provided with a null file path. This is important for error handling.

Scenario 4: Empty File Path
Details:  
  TestName: testEmptyFilePath
  Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles an empty string as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide an empty string as the file path.
  Act: Invoke the readManifest method with the empty string.
  Assert: Verify that an exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly throws an exception when provided with an empty string. This is important for error handling.

Scenario 5: File Path with Non-Existent Directory
Details:  
  TestName: testNonExistentDirectoryInFilePath
  Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles a file path that includes a non-existent directory.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a file path that includes a non-existent directory.
  Act: Invoke the readManifest method with the given file path.
  Assert: Verify that an exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly throws an exception when provided with a file path that includes a non-existent directory. This is important for error handling.
