"""
Scenario 1: Valid File Path
TestName: readManifestWithValidFilePath
Description: The test is meant to check if the method can successfully read a file when provided with a valid file path.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a valid file path and mock the readFile method to return the expected output. 
  Act: Invoke the readManifest method with the valid file path. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected output.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method can correctly read a file given a valid file path. This is significant as it ensures the method can perform its primary function correctly.

Scenario 2: Invalid File Path
TestName: readManifestWithInvalidFilePath
Description: The test is meant to check if the method throws a ZipEntryNotFoundException when provided with an invalid file path.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an invalid file path and mock the readFile method to throw a ZipEntryNotFoundException.
  Act: Invoke the readManifest method with the invalid file path.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that a ZipEntryNotFoundException is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly throws a ZipEntryNotFoundException when provided with an invalid file path. This is important for error handling.

Scenario 3: Null File Path
TestName: readManifestWithNullFilePath
Description: The test is meant to check if the method throws a NullPointerException when provided with a null file path.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a null file path.
  Act: Invoke the readManifest method with the null file path.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that a NullPointerException is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly throws a NullPointerException when provided with a null file path. This is important for error handling and to prevent potential crashes.

Scenario 4: Empty File Path
TestName: readManifestWithEmptyFilePath
Description: The test is meant to check if the method throws a ZipReadException when provided with an empty file path.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an empty file path and mock the readFile method to throw a ZipReadException.
  Act: Invoke the readManifest method with the empty file path.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that a ZipReadException is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly throws a ZipReadException when provided with an empty file path. This is crucial for error handling and to ensure that only valid file paths are accepted.
