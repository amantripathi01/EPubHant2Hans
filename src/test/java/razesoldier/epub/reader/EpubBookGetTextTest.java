================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The getText() method is public and might be accessed inappropriately, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive information.
Solution: Restrict the visibility of the method if it is not necessary outside of its class or package. Use secure methods to access data, such as POST instead of GET, and provide user permissions and authentication checks.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The getText() method might be a debug function that was left in the production code. This could lead to exposure of sensitive information.
Solution: Ensure that all debug code is removed or disabled before moving to production. Use logging libraries that can be configured to print debug information only in development environments.

Vulnerability: CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
Issue: The getText() method might be using untrusted input without proper validation or sanitization, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), or Command Injection.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize inputs. Use prepared statements for SQL queries, encode data for HTML output, and avoid using user input directly in commands or file paths.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The getText() method might be exposing sensitive data by returning it to the caller. This could lead to information leakage.
Solution: Ensure that the data returned by the method is not sensitive or is properly encrypted. Implement access controls and user permissions to restrict who can access the data.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to verify getText method returns correct text

Details:  
  TestName: testGetTextReturnsCorrectText
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getText method returns the correct text which was previously set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the text to a known value.
  Act: Invoke getText.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned text is the same as the known value.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if the getText method is returning the correct text. The expected result is the same as the known value because that's what we have set as the text. This test is significant as it verifies the basic functionality of the getText method.

Scenario 2: Test to verify getText method returns null when text is not set

Details:  
  TestName: testGetTextReturnsNullWhenTextNotSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getText method returns null when the text is not set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Do not set the text.
  Act: Invoke getText.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned text is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if the getText method returns null when the text is not set. The expected result is null since we have not set any text. This test is important as it checks the behavior of the getText method when the text is not set.

Scenario 3: Test to verify getText method returns empty string when text is set to empty string

Details:  
  TestName: testGetTextReturnsEmptyStringWhenTextIsEmpty
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getText method returns an empty string when the text is set to an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the text to an empty string.
  Act: Invoke getText.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned text is an empty string.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if the getText method returns an empty string when the text is set to an empty string. The expected result is an empty string as that's what we've set as the text. This test is important as it checks the behavior of the getText method when the text is set to an empty string.
