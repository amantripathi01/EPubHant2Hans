================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: The function writeManifest uses string concatenation to build a file path which can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities if the dstPath variable is user-controlled and not properly sanitized. An attacker can manipulate the dstPath to access files outside of the intended directory.
Solution: Use Java's built-in File class to create the file path. This class automatically takes care of any necessary path normalization. Sanitize user input to remove any directory traversal characters or sequences.

Vulnerability: CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
Issue: The function writeManifest uses writeFile function to write into a file. If writeFile does not properly handle exceptions or control file permissions, it can lead to vulnerabilities. It can result in data corruption, loss, or disclosure to unauthorized parties.
Solution: Ensure that writeFile function properly handles exceptions, and controls file permissions. Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions. Use Java's built-in security features to restrict file permissions.

Vulnerability: CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')
Issue: If the newText parameter of writeManifest function is user-controlled and not properly sanitized, it can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. An attacker can provide a large size of newText to cause a buffer overflow.
Solution: Sanitize user input to ensure the size of newText is within acceptable limits. Use Java's built-in length checking functions to prevent buffer overflows.

"""
  Scenario 1: Test to check if manifest file is written correctly with valid inputs

  Details:  
    TestName: testWriteManifestWithValidInputs
    Description: This test checks if the writeManifest method correctly writes the provided text to the specified destination path when valid inputs are provided. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide valid 'dstPath' and 'newText' input values.
    Act: Invoke the writeManifest method with the valid inputs.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the content of the file at the destination path with the provided text.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the writeManifest method correctly writes the provided text to the specified destination path. This is important to ensure that the manifest file is correctly updated with the new text.

  Scenario 2: Test to check error handling when destination path is invalid

  Details:  
    TestName: testWriteManifestWithInvalidDstPath
    Description: This test checks how the writeManifest method handles the scenario when an invalid destination path is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide an invalid 'dstPath' input value and a valid 'newText' input value.
    Act: Invoke the writeManifest method with the invalid destination path.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if an appropriate exception is thrown.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the writeManifest method correctly handles the scenario when an invalid destination path is provided. This is important to ensure that the program does not crash and provides meaningful error messages to the user.

  Scenario 3: Test to check error handling when null text is provided

  Details:  
    TestName: testWriteManifestWithNullText
    Description: This test checks how the writeManifest method handles the scenario when null text is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide a valid 'dstPath' input value and a null 'newText' input value.
    Act: Invoke the writeManifest method with the null text.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if an appropriate exception is thrown.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the writeManifest method correctly handles the scenario when null text is provided. This is important to ensure that the program does not crash and provides meaningful error messages to the user.
