================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: The function readFileWithStream uses user-supplied input in a filesystem operation. This can potentially allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system by supplying specially-crafted input, leading to exposure of sensitive information.
Solution: Sanitize the user input to remove any path traversal sequences. Also, use a whitelist of allowed paths or files.

Vulnerability: CWE-396: Declaration of Catch for Generic Exception
Issue: The catch block in the readFileWithStream function catches a generic IOException. This can potentially mask other exceptions and make debugging difficult. It can also lead to unintended behavior if an unexpected exception type is thrown.
Solution: Use catch blocks for more specific exception types, and handle each exception type appropriately. If a generic Exception must be caught, rethrow it as a new, more specific exception.

Vulnerability: CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
Issue: The InputStream returned by the function readFileWithStream is not closed within the function. This can lead to resource leaks if the caller forgets to close the stream.
Solution: Close the InputStream within a finally block to ensure it is always closed, even if an exception is thrown. Alternatively, use a try-with-resources statement to automatically close the stream.

"""
Scenario 1: Test valid file path
Details:  
  TestName: testValidFilePath
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly opens an InputStream for a valid file path. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid file path.
  Act: Invoke the readFileWithStream method with the valid file path as parameter.
  Assert: Check if an InputStream is returned.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly opens an InputStream for a valid file path. This test is significant as it checks the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test invalid file path
Details:  
  TestName: testInvalidFilePath
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method throws a ZipReadException when an invalid file path is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an invalid file path.
  Act: Invoke the readFileWithStream method with the invalid file path as parameter.
  Assert: Check if a ZipReadException is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method throws an exception when an invalid file path is provided, ensuring that the method handles this error condition correctly.

Scenario 3: Test non-existent file path
Details:  
  TestName: testNonExistentFilePath
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method throws a ZipEntryNotFoundException when a non-existent file path is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a non-existent file path.
  Act: Invoke the readFileWithStream method with the non-existent file path as parameter.
  Assert: Check if a ZipEntryNotFoundException is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method throws an exception when a non-existent file path is provided, ensuring that the method handles this error condition correctly.

Scenario 4: Test null file path
Details:  
  TestName: testNullFilePath
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method throws a NullPointerException when a null file path is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a null file path.
  Act: Invoke the readFileWithStream method with the null file path as parameter.
  Assert: Check if a NullPointerException is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method throws an exception when a null file path is provided, ensuring that the method handles this error condition correctly. 

Scenario 5: Test empty file path
Details:  
  TestName: testEmptyFilePath
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method throws a ZipEntryNotFoundException when an empty file path is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty file path.
  Act: Invoke the readFileWithStream method with the empty file path as parameter.
  Assert: Check if a ZipEntryNotFoundException is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method throws an exception when an empty file path is provided, ensuring that the method handles this error condition correctly.
