================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: The function readFileWithStream uses user-supplied input to access files. If the input is not properly validated, an attacker could manipulate the 'filepath' to read arbitrary files on the system which could lead to exposure of sensitive information.
Solution: Ensure to validate and sanitize the 'filepath' input. Avoid using user-supplied input directly in file system operations without proper validation. Use a whitelist of allowed paths and filenames. Additionally, consider using a library or framework that automatically handles these issues.

Vulnerability: CWE-396: Declare Throwables Correctly
Issue: The function readFileWithStream declares to throw IOException. This is a broad exception that can catch more than one type of error which can lead to information leakage or misinterpretation of the problem at higher levels of the code.
Solution: Avoid throwing or catching broad exceptions. Use the specific exceptions that fit your particular situation.

Vulnerability: CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
Issue: The InputStream returned by readFileWithStream method is not being closed in a finally block or using try-with-resources. If an exception occurs before the stream is closed, the stream will remain open, leading to a resource leak.
Solution: Use try-with-resources or make sure the stream is closed in a finally block.

"""
Scenario 1: Test when the file path provided exists and is valid

Details:  
  TestName: testValidFilePath.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly opens a stream for reading the file when a valid file path is provided. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a valid file path that exists in the file system.
  Act: Invoke the readFileWithStream method with the valid file path.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned object is an instance of InputStream.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly opens a stream for reading the file when a valid file path is provided. This test is significant in ensuring that the method handles valid inputs as expected.

Scenario 2: Test when the file path provided does not exist

Details:  
  TestName: testNonExistentFilePath.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method throws a ZipEntryNotFoundException when the file path provided does not exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a file path that does not exist in the file system.
  Act: Invoke the readFileWithStream method with the non-existent file path.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that a ZipEntryNotFoundException is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly throws an exception when the file path provided does not exist. This test is significant in ensuring that the method handles error scenarios as expected.

Scenario 3: Test when an IOException is thrown while trying to open the file stream

Details:  
  TestName: testIOExceptionDuringFileOpening.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method throws a ZipReadException when an IOException occurs while trying to open the file stream.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the Files.newInputStream method to throw an IOException when called.
  Act: Invoke the readFileWithStream method with a valid file path.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that a ZipReadException is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly throws a ZipReadException when an IOException occurs while trying to open the file stream. This test is significant in ensuring that the method handles unexpected exceptions correctly.
