Scenario 1: Successful read of valid file with stream

Details:  
  TestName: testReadFileWithStream
  Description: This test is meant to check the successful read of a valid file using the readFileWithStream method. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid file path as a string and set up the method 'entryNoExists(filepath)' to return false.
  Act: Invoke readFileWithStream with the valid file path. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that an InputStream is returned.
Validation: 
  Assert aims to verify that the method correctly reads the file and returns an InputStream. The expected result is that the method returns an InputStream without any exceptions. This test is significant as it ensures the method's basic functionality of reading a file is working as expected.

Scenario 2: Reading a non-existing file 

Details:  
  TestName: testReadNonExistingFile
  Description: This test is meant to check the method's behavior when trying to read a file that does not exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a non-existing file path as a string and set up the method 'entryNoExists(filepath)' to return true.
  Act: Invoke readFileWithStream with the non-existing file path. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that a ZipEntryNotFoundException is thrown.
Validation: 
  Assert aims to verify that the method correctly throws a ZipEntryNotFoundException when trying to read a non-existing file. The expected result is that a ZipEntryNotFoundException is thrown. This test is significant as it ensures the method's error handling is working correctly when a non-existing file is attempted to be read.

Scenario 3: Reading a file with IOException 

Details:  
  TestName: testReadFileWithIOException
  Description: This test is meant to check the method's behavior when an IOException occurs during the reading of the file.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid file path as a string and set up the method 'entryNoExists(filepath)' to return false. Also, mock the Files.newInputStream(path) method to throw an IOException.
  Act: Invoke readFileWithStream with the valid file path. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that a ZipReadException is thrown.
Validation: 
  Assert aims to verify that the method correctly throws a ZipReadException when an IOException occurs during the reading of the file. The expected result is that a ZipReadException is thrown. This test is significant as it ensures the method's error handling is working correctly when an IOException occurs.
