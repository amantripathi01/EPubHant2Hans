================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: The method writeFile() does not validate the destination path (dstPath) that is passed as a parameter. An attacker could potentially manipulate this parameter to override important files or write files to restricted directories.
Solution: Validate the dstPath parameter to ensure that it does not contain relative file paths or symbolic links that could lead to path traversal. Use methods like Path.normalize() and Path.toRealPath() to resolve these paths.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The method writeFile() does not explicitly set the file permissions when creating a new file. This could potentially result in the file being created with default permissions that are too permissive, allowing unauthorized users to read, modify, or delete the file.
Solution: Set the file permissions explicitly when creating a new file. Use the Files.createFile() method with a FileAttribute parameter to set the permissions at the time of file creation.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The method writeFile() does not validate the input data (newText) that is written to the file. An attacker could potentially inject malicious data.
Solution: Validate the newText parameter to ensure that it does not contain any malicious data before writing it to the file. Use a safe data processing API or library to sanitize the input.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if the file is written with the provided text
Details:  
  TestName: testWriteFileWithProvidedText
  Description: This test checks if the method writes the provided text into the file at the given destination path.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide a valid destination path and a text to be written.
    Act: Invoke writeFile method with the provided path and text.
    Assert: Read the file at the destination path and assert if the file content matches the provided text.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies if the file at the given path contains the exact text provided to the method. This confirms that the method is writing the text into the file as expected.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the file is overwritten with new text
Details:  
  TestName: testOverwriteFileWithNewText
  Description: This test checks if the method overwrites the existing file with the new text.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide a valid destination path of an existing file and a new text to be written.
    Act: Invoke writeFile method with the provided path and new text.
    Assert: Read the file at the destination path and assert if the file content matches the new text.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies if the file at the given path contains the new text. This confirms that the method is overwriting the existing file with the new text as expected.

Scenario 3: Test to check the behaviour when an invalid path is provided
Details:  
  TestName: testWriteFileWithInvalidPath
  Description: This test checks the behaviour of the method when an invalid destination path is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide an invalid destination path and a text to be written.
    Act: Invoke writeFile method with the provided invalid path and text.
    Assert: Assert that an exception is thrown.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies if an exception is thrown when an invalid path is provided. This confirms the method's error handling for invalid paths.

Scenario 4: Test to check the behaviour when null text is provided
Details:  
  TestName: testWriteFileWithNullText
  Description: This test checks the behaviour of the method when null text is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide a valid destination path and null text.
    Act: Invoke writeFile method with the provided path and null text.
    Assert: Assert that an exception is thrown.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies if an exception is thrown when null text is provided. This confirms the method's error handling for null inputs.
