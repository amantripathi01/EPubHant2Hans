================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) or CWE-639
Issue: The method 'getBook()' returns a direct reference to the internal 'epubBook' object. This can potentially allow an attacker to manipulate or access unauthorized data if the object reference is exposed to user input.
Solution: Consider returning a copy of the 'epubBook' object or use an access control check before returning the object. Implement proper input validation if the reference is exposed to user input.

Vulnerability: Improper Access Control or CWE-284
Issue: The method 'getBook()' is public and can be accessed by any class in the application. If 'epubBook' contains sensitive data, it can be exposed to unauthorized access.
Solution: Consider reducing the visibility of 'getBook()' method or implement an access control mechanism to prevent unauthorized access to 'epubBook' object.

Vulnerability: Unvalidated Inputs or CWE-20
Issue: While not directly visible in the provided code, there is a potential risk if user inputs are used to manipulate or access the 'epubBook' object. This can lead to various vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or SQL Injection.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize user inputs before using them in your application. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL Injection.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if getBook returns the correct EPUBBook instance

Details:  
  TestName: testGetBookReturnsCorrectInstance.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getBook method returns the correct instance of EPUBBook. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the getBook method and assign an EPUBBook instance to the epubBook field.
  Act: Invoke the getBook method.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to compare the returned object with the expected EPUBBook instance.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getBook method is returning the correct instance of EPUBBook. This test is significant to ensure that the correct book is being retrieved when the getBook method is called.

Scenario 2: Test to check if getBook returns null

Details:  
  TestName: testGetBookReturnsNull.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getBook method returns null when epubBook has not been initialized. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the getBook method without initializing the epubBook field.
  Act: Invoke the getBook method.
  Assert: Use assertNull to check if the returned object is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getBook method returns null when the epubBook field is not initialized. This test is significant to ensure that the getBook method handles the scenario where the epubBook field has not been initialized.

Scenario 3: Test to check if getBook returns the same instance on subsequent calls

Details:  
  TestName: testGetBookReturnsSameInstance.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getBook method returns the same instance of EPUBBook on subsequent calls. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the getBook method and assign an EPUBBook instance to the epubBook field.
  Act: Invoke the getBook method twice.
  Assert: Use assertSame to compare the two returned objects.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getBook method is returning the same instance of EPUBBook on subsequent calls. This test is significant to ensure that the getBook method is consistent in its behavior.
