Scenario 1: Testing to ensure the getBook method returns the expected EPUBBook object

Details:  
  TestName: testGetBookReturnsCorrectEPUBBook.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getBook method returns the expected EPUBBook object. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock instance of EPUBBook and set it as the epubBook field of the class. 
  Act: Invoke the getBook method. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned object against the mock EPUBBook object.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify the correctness of the getBook method. The expected result is the mock EPUBBook object because that is what was set in the class. 
  This test is significant in ensuring the getBook method is working correctly and returning the expected object.

Scenario 2: Testing to ensure the getBook method returns null when epubBook is not initialized

Details:  
  TestName: testGetBookReturnsNullWhenEPUBBookNotInitialized.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getBook method returns null when epubBook is not initialized. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure the epubBook field of the class is null. 
  Act: Invoke the getBook method. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned object is null.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify the correctness of the getBook method when epubBook is not initialized. The expected result is null as there is no EPUBBook object to return. 
  This test is significant in ensuring the getBook method handles the scenario where the epubBook object is not initialized.

Scenario 3: Testing to ensure the getBook method does not affect the state of the epubBook object

Details:  
  TestName: testGetBookDoesNotAlterEPUBBookState.
  Description: This test is meant to check if invoking the getBook method alters the state of the epubBook object. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock instance of EPUBBook and set it as the epubBook field of the class. 
  Act: Invoke the getBook method. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the state of the epubBook object before and after the getBook method invocation.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify that the getBook method does not alter the state of the epubBook object. The expected result is that the state of the epubBook object remains the same before and after the getBook method invocation. 
  This test is significant in ensuring the getBook method does not have any side effects on the epubBook object.
