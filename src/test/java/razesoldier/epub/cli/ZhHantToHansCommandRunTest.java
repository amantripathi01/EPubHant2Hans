================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-396: Uncaught Exception
Issue: The code has a catch block that catches an exception and rethrows a new RuntimeException. This can lead to unintended program termination if the exception is not properly handled by the caller.
Solution: Instead of rethrowing a new RuntimeException, it's better to either handle the specific exception types or rethrow the same exception so the caller can handle it.

Vulnerability: CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
Issue: The InputStream objects are not closed in a finally block. This can lead to resource leaks and denial of service attacks.
Solution: Always close InputStream in a finally block or use try-with-resources to automatically close the resources.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The code does not seem to enforce any access control while reading or writing to the manifest file. This can lead to unauthorized access to data.
Solution: Implement access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to the manifest file.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not validate the input before processing the manifest file. This can lead to various vulnerabilities like buffer overflow, integer overflow, etc.
Solution: Always validate the input before processing. Use secure functions for parsing and conversion of data.

"""
Scenario 1: Successful conversion and writing of manifest
Details:  
  TestName: testSuccessfulConversionAndWriting.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method can successfully convert and write the manifest.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock 'reader' and 'manifest' objects. Set up the 'reader' to return a specific text when 'readManifest' is called and to not throw any exception when 'writeManifest' is called.
    Act: Invoke the 'run' method.
    Assert: Verify that 'reader.readManifest' and 'reader.writeManifest' were called with the correct parameters.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the method can successfully convert and write the manifest. The test is significant as it validates the primary functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Handling of ZipEntryNotFoundException
Details:  
  TestName: testHandlingOfZipEntryNotFoundException.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method can properly handle a ZipEntryNotFoundException.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock 'reader' object that throws a ZipEntryNotFoundException when 'readManifest' is called.
    Act: Invoke the 'run' method.
    Assert: Expect a RuntimeException to be thrown.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the method properly wraps and throws a RuntimeException when a ZipEntryNotFoundException is encountered. This is important for error handling and ensuring that the application can gracefully handle unexpected exceptions.

Scenario 3: Handling of ZipReadException
Details:  
  TestName: testHandlingOfZipReadException.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method can properly handle a ZipReadException.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock 'reader' object that throws a ZipReadException when 'readManifest' is called.
    Act: Invoke the 'run' method.
    Assert: Expect a RuntimeException to be thrown.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the method properly wraps and throws a RuntimeException when a ZipReadException is encountered. This is important for error handling and ensuring that the application can gracefully handle unexpected exceptions.

Scenario 4: Handling of IOException
Details:  
  TestName: testHandlingOfIOException.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method can properly handle an IOException.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock 'reader' object that throws an IOException when 'readManifest' is called.
    Act: Invoke the 'run' method.
    Assert: Expect a RuntimeException to be thrown.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the method properly wraps and throws a RuntimeException when an IOException is encountered. This is important for error handling and ensuring that the application can gracefully handle unexpected exceptions.
