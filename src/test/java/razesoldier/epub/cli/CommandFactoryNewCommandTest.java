Scenario 1: Valid Key String and Context

Details:  
TestName: testNewCommandWithValidKeyAndContext
Description: This test is meant to check if the method returns the correct Command object when a valid key string and context are provided. 
Execution:
Arrange: Create a valid key string "hant2hans" and a valid Context object.
Act: Invoke the newCommand method with the valid key and context.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned command is an instance of ZhHantToHansCommand.
Validation: 
The assertion verifies that the method correctly creates and returns a ZhHantToHansCommand object when provided with a valid key and context. This is important as it ensures the method can correctly process valid inputs.

Scenario 2: Invalid Key String and Valid Context

Details:  
TestName: testNewCommandWithInvalidKeyAndValidContext
Description: This test is meant to check if the method returns null when an invalid key string and a valid context are provided.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an invalid key string (not "hant2hans") and a valid Context object.
Act: Invoke the newCommand method with the invalid key and valid context.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned command is null.
Validation: 
The assertion verifies that the method correctly returns null when provided with an invalid key, regardless of the context. This is crucial as it ensures the method can handle and appropriately respond to invalid inputs.

Scenario 3: Null Key String and Valid Context

Details:  
TestName: testNewCommandWithNullKeyAndValidContext
Description: This test is meant to check if the method throws a NullPointerException when a null key string and a valid context are provided.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a null key string and a valid Context object.
Act: Invoke the newCommand method with the null key and valid context.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect a NullPointerException.
Validation: 
The assertion verifies that the method correctly throws a NullPointerException when provided with a null key. This is crucial as it ensures the method enforces the non-null constraint on the key parameter. 

Scenario 4: Valid Key String and Null Context

Details:  
TestName: testNewCommandWithValidKeyAndNullContext
Description: This test is meant to check if the method throws a NullPointerException when a valid key string and a null context are provided.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a valid key string and a null Context object.
Act: Invoke the newCommand method with the valid key and null context.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect a NullPointerException.
Validation: 
The assertion verifies that the method correctly throws a NullPointerException when provided with a null context. This is crucial as it ensures the method enforces the non-null constraint on the context parameter.
