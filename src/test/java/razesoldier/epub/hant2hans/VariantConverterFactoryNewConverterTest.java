  Scenario 1: Testing the Normal Functionality of the Method

  Details:  
    TestName: testNewConverterFunctionality
    Description: This test is designed to verify if the method newConverter() creates and returns a new object of type MynlpConverter successfully. This is the basic functionality of the method and it should return a non-null object. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No data arrangement is required as the method does not take any parameters.
    Act: Invoke the newConverter() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned object is not null and it's an instance of MynlpConverter class.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the method is returning a non-null object of type MynlpConverter. If the object is null or not of the expected type, the test will fail. This test is significant as it verifies the basic functionality of the method.

  Scenario 2: Testing the Contract Annotation of the Method

  Details:  
    TestName: testContractAnnotation
    Description: This test is designed to verify if the method newConverter() is pure and always returns a new object (as specified by the @Contract annotation). This test ensures that the method does not have side effects and does not modify any state.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No data arrangement is required as the method does not take any parameters.
    Act: Invoke the newConverter() method twice.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the two returned objects are not identical (i.e., they are not the same object).
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify the purity and newness contract of the method. If the method returns the same object more than once, the test will fail. This test is significant as it ensures that the method adheres to its contract and does not have side effects.

  Scenario 3: Testing the NotNull Annotation of the Method

  Details:  
    TestName: testNotNullAnnotation
    Description: This test is designed to verify that the method newConverter() never returns a null value (as specified by the @NotNull annotation). This test ensures that the method always returns a valid object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No data arrangement is required as the method does not take any parameters.
    Act: Invoke the newConverter() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned object is not null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify the NotNull contract of the method. If the method returns a null value, the test will fail. This test is significant as it ensures that the method always returns a valid object, and never null.
