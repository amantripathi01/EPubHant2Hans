================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-470: Uncontrolled Search Path Element
Issue: The code uses a third-party library, which might not have been properly sanitized or validated. This can lead to a potential security vulnerability, where an attacker can exploit this to load malicious code or data.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize any third-party libraries before use. Consider using a tool to automatically check for vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.

Vulnerability: CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
Issue: The `newConverter` method creates a new `MynlpConverter` object each time it is called, which could potentially lead to resource exhaustion if not properly managed.
Solution: Consider using a design pattern that controls the number of instances of `MynlpConverter` that can be created, such as the Singleton or Object Pool pattern.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The use of `@NotNull` and `@Contract` annotations indicates that the code might be in a debug state. If debug code is left in the production environment, it can expose sensitive information and system internals to an attacker.
Solution: Remove any debug code or make sure it is properly isolated and can't be executed in a production environment.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing successful creation of a new converter

  Details:  
    TestName: testSuccessfulCreationOfNewConverter.
    Description: This test is meant to check if a new converter is successfully created when the newConverter method is invoked. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
    Act: Invoke the newConverter method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned object is an instance of MynlpConverter.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the newConverter method correctly creates and returns a new MynlpConverter object. The test is important in ensuring that the method is capable of creating a new converter as expected.

Scenario 2: Testing the singleton property of the converter

  Details:  
    TestName: testSingletonPropertyOfConverter.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the newConverter method always returns a new instance of the MynlpConverter. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as the method does not take any parameters.
    Act: Invoke the newConverter method twice.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the two returned objects are not the same instance.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the newConverter method does not return a singleton instance, but creates a new instance every time it's called. This test is crucial in ensuring that multiple calls to the method do not return the same instance, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the context of the application.

Scenario 3: Testing the exception handling of the converter creation

  Details:  
    TestName: testExceptionHandlingOfConverterCreation.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the newConverter method handles exceptions properly when it fails to create a new MynlpConverter. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Manipulate the environment to cause the newConverter method to fail in creating a new MynlpConverter.
    Act: Invoke the newConverter method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the method throws the expected exception.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the newConverter method handles exceptions properly when it fails to create a new MynlpConverter. This test is crucial in ensuring that the method handles failure scenarios correctly and does not crash the application.
