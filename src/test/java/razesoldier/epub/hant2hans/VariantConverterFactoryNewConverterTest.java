================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The code uses annotations from JetBrain's IntelliJ IDEA, which is typically used for debugging and should not be left in production code. This can lead to information disclosure, as it may reveal internal workings of the code.
Solution: Remove all debug annotations before the code is moved to production. If needed, use logging frameworks for debug information, and make sure the logging is configurable to be turned off in production.

Vulnerability: CWE-470: Unrestricted Creation of Objects
Issue: The method 'newConverter' creates a new instance of 'MynlpConverter' without any restrictions. If this method is exposed to untrusted data or users, it could be exploited to create an arbitrary number of objects, leading to resource exhaustion.
Solution: Implement restrictions or checks to control the creation of new objects. This could be a simple count restriction or more complex checks based on user permissions or other conditions.

================================================================================
"""
  Scenario 1: Successful Instantiation of MynlpConverter

  Details:  
    TestName: testSuccessfulInstantiationOfMynlpConverter
    Description: This test is meant to check if the 'newConverter' method successfully creates an instance of the 'MynlpConverter' class. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup data or mocks are required for this test. 
    Act: Invoke the 'newConverter' method. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned object is an instance of 'MynlpConverter'.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the 'newConverter' method correctly creates an instance of 'MynlpConverter'. The expected result is that an object of the 'MynlpConverter' class is created. This is important as it confirms the correct behavior of the method, allowing it to be used for further conversions.

  Scenario 2: Not Null Test for MynlpConverter Instantiation

  Details:  
    TestName: testNotNullMynlpConverterInstantiation
    Description: This test is meant to check if the 'newConverter' method returns a non-null object. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup data or mocks are required for this test. 
    Act: Invoke the 'newConverter' method. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned object is not null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the 'newConverter' method does not return a null object. The expected result is a non-null object. This is important as it confirms that the method is correctly instantiating an object of 'MynlpConverter', preventing null pointer exceptions in the application.

  Scenario 3: Singleton Property of MynlpConverter

  Details:  
    TestName: testSingletonPropertyOfMynlpConverter
    Description: This test is meant to check if the 'newConverter' method always returns a new instance of 'MynlpConverter'. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup data or mocks are required for this test. 
    Act: Invoke the 'newConverter' method twice. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the two returned objects.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the 'newConverter' method always returns a new instance of 'MynlpConverter'. The expected result is that the two objects are not the same. This is important as it confirms the non-singleton behavior of the 'newConverter' method, ensuring that each invocation creates a new conversion object.
