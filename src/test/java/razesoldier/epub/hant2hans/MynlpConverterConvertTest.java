================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
Issue: The code does not sanitize or validate the source input in the 'convert' function, which could lead to URL redirection attacks if the source is a URL.
Solution: Use a URL validator or sanitizer to ensure the source input is safe. This can be done using Java's built-in URL class or a trusted third-party library.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: The source input is directly used in the 'convert' function without any form of sanitization or validation, this can lead to SQL injection if the source is used in an SQL query.
Solution: Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. Java's built-in PreparedStatement class can be used for this purpose.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: The source input is directly used in the 'convert' function without any form of sanitization or validation, this can lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks if the source is used in a web page.
Solution: Use a trusted library to sanitize the source input before using it in a web page. Java's built-in HtmlEscapers class can be used for this purpose.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The code does not handle exceptions, which could lead to exposure of sensitive information through error messages.
Solution: Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and avoid exposing sensitive information through error messages. Java's built-in Exception class can be used for this purpose.

"""
Scenario 1: Test Conversion with Valid Input

Details:  
  TestName: testConversionWithValidInput
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the convert method can successfully transform a valid input string using the converter. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a valid input string. 
  Act: Invoke the convert method with the valid input string. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual transformed string against the expected transformed string.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the convert method can accurately transform valid input strings. The expected result is based on the functionality of the converter. This test is significant in ensuring that the convert method is functioning correctly with valid inputs.

Scenario 2: Test Conversion with Empty Input

Details:  
  TestName: testConversionWithEmptyInput
  Description: This test is meant to check how the convert method handles an empty input string. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an empty input string. 
  Act: Invoke the convert method with the empty input string. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual transformed string against the expected transformed string (which should also be empty).
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the convert method can handle empty input strings without throwing errors. The expected result is an empty string, as there are no characters in the input to transform. This test is important in checking the robustness of the convert method.

Scenario 3: Test Conversion with Null Input

Details:  
  TestName: testConversionWithNullInput
  Description: This test is meant to check how the convert method handles a null input string. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a null input string. 
  Act: Invoke the convert method with the null input string. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect a NullPointerException to be thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the convert method can handle null input strings without causing unexpected behavior. The expected result is a NullPointerException, as the convert method should not be able to process null inputs. This test is crucial in ensuring that the convert method can handle unexpected input values. 

Scenario 4: Test Conversion with Special Characters Input

Details:  
  TestName: testConversionWithSpecialCharactersInput
  Description: This test is meant to check how the convert method handles input strings with special characters. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an input string containing special characters. 
  Act: Invoke the convert method with the special characters input string. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual transformed string against the expected transformed string.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the convert method can handle input strings with special characters without causing unexpected behavior. The expected result is based on the functionality of the converter. This test is important in ensuring that the convert method can handle a variety of input string formats.
